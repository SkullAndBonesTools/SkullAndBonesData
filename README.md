# Skull and Bones Data
---
Welcome to the inofficial data repository for the Skull and Bones game by Ubisoft.

This repository hosts data for the several elements in the game like **Materials**, **Items**, **Cosmetics** and more in a JSON format.

As the move to a public repository (see #history) includes several changes the following things are planned:
- [ ] Extract events, locations, contracts into own data files
  - Those are currently only stored in the translation files
- [ ] Crowdin workflow integration
- [ ] npm packages with generated types for the different data (events, cosmetics, items, ...)

For each update of the game a new release is provided containing the updated files which can be found under the [Releases](https://github.com/SkullAndBonesTools/SkullAndBonesData/releases) section.
