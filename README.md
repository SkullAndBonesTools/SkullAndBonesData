# Skull and Bones Data

Welcome to the inofficial data repository for the Skull and Bones game by Ubisoft.

This repository hosts data for the several elements in the game like **Materials**, **Items**, **Cosmetics** and more in a JSON format and provides a npm package to access the data in typescript and javascript.

As the move to a public repository (see [History](#history)) includes several changes the following things are planned:
- [ ] Extract data stored in translation files into own data files
  - [x] Sets
  - [x] Events
  - [x] World Events
  - [ ] Locations
- [ ] Crowdin workflow integration
- [x] npm packages with generated types for the different data (events, cosmetics, items, ...)

For each update of the game a new release is provided containing the updated files which can be found under the [Releases](https://github.com/SkullAndBonesTools/SkullAndBonesData/releases) section.

The version schema of the release is tied to the Skull and Bones version the data represents and put together like so:\
**Example**: snbdata@5.2.4
```
5 - Season (a year has 4 seasons, so season 5 = Y2S1)
2 - Patch Level
4 - Bug Fixes / Minor Changes (this one is related to releases of this repository)

This represents the SnB game version Y2S1.2.X
```

*Because the first published version of the package was for Y2S1, so season 5 of Skull and Bones, the first release was the 5.0.0.*

## How to Use
### Raw Data
You can find the raw data files as JSON in the [data](https://github.com/SkullAndBonesTools/SkullAndBonesData/tree/master/data) folder.

### Package
Based on the raw data is the `snbdata` npm package available, featuring access to the data as objects with type safety and autocompletion.

#### Guide
**Install the Package**\
~~`npm i @skullandbonestools/snbdata`~~`  // Package will be available in the coming days`

**Access the Data**

Getting the season of the `Barque` (TS):
```typescript
import { Ships } from "@skullandbonestools/snbdata";
import { Season } from '@skullandbonestools/snbdata/dist/daos/seasons';

const season:Season = Ships.barque.season; // Retrieves the season object for the barque
console.log(season.id); // Returns ragingTides
```

Getting the required materials for `Orca Intricate Apparatus` (JS):
```javascript
import { Materials } from "@skullandbonestools/snbdata";

// Only check required materials not their amount
Materials.orcaIntricateApparatus.required.keys().forEach(material => {
  console.log("Id: %s - Required: %s", material.id, material.required?.keys().map((m) => m.id).toArray().join(", "));
});

// Output
Id: orcasMechanism - Required: undefined
Id: torsionSpring - Required: planetaryGearset, woodPitch
Id: planetaryGearset - Required: cogwheel
Id: woodPitch - Required: woodTar
```
